# hello-world
My first incursion into unknown territory. Forever learning, even in the Autumn of my life. (Assuming I live to be no less than  80 years old.) 

So, with this information, can you guess my age? I will give you another hint to narrow it down even further. 

I am also in the Autumn years of the Autumn years, of my life. (Again, assuming I live to be 80 years old.)
